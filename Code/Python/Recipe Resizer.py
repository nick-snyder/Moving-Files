# Create a program for Ms. Vashaw that will change the yield output for a given recipe.

# or reduce the amounts (half it or quarter it). 
# The user should be able to input original ingredient quantities and recipeâ€™s yield, 
# then using mathematical expressions, give the increase or decrease for that recipe based on what the user wants.
