%This MATLAB script will give you an introduction to MATLAB's capabilities.
%CAUTION: When you are typing in lines interactively, you should ignore lines
%that start with the % symbol, since those are just comments.  Also, the 
%pause commands should be skipped as well as the disp (display) commands.
%In the future, you should remember that if you put a semicolon (;) at the
%end of a line, MATLAB doesn't print out to the screen - this is very useful
%if you are defining a vector with 100,000 elements.  When you are done
%with MATLAB, just type quit and you will exit.  The best place to look for
%information on a given MATLAB function is in the Reference Guide, and if
%you want to learn more about the overall operation of MATLAB, read the 
%Tutorial in Chapter 2 of the User's Guide.
