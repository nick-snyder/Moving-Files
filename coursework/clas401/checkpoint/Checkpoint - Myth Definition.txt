1) "A myth is not a specific poetic text. It transcends the text, it is the
subject matter, the plot fixed in a broad outline with characters no less
fixed, with the induvidual poet is free to alter only within limits."

2) "What myth tells is in some way false or else it would be history. Yet within
mythology, there are gradations of credibility."

3) I find the Graf definition more compelling to me because it takes into account
that is has the ability to change and adapt over time through the mouths
and pens of generations of different people. I don't really feel the need to
compare myths and history like Dowden because today they're viewed much
differently by society that a myth is more akin to a form of art which is best
left subjective.
