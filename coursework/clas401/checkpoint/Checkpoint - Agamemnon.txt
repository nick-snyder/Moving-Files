1) Describe the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles. As a poet of the modern day put it, 'What's the beef?'
    
    Agamemnon took Briseis from Achilles, angering Achilles and straining their relationship.

2) In your own opinion, who deserves more credit: Agamemnon or Achilles? Why?

    I think they both deserve credit. Not many other people could do what either of them had done. 

3) If you were Zeus, would you have sided with the Achaeans or the Trojans? Was there any happy resolution possible for the Trojan War?

    Zeus would have preferred the Achaeans to win because the war was fought to return the stolen wife of king Menelaus. I believe Zeus would also fight for that. The only possible happy resolution would have been if Paris surrendered Helen once the Achaeans arrived.
